This is my personal portfolio website, designed to introduce myself and provide a way to get in touch. It is built using HTML and basic CSS. The website currently includes two pages:

Home: A brief introduction and overview of who I am and my background.
Contact: A simple contact form for anyone who wishes to reach out.
This project showcases my skills in web development, using clean and minimal design techniques.
